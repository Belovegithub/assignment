<h1><b>Travelling in Depression</b></h1>
<p>when i was very little,i caught the travel bug.it started after my grandparent first bought <br>
 me to their home in france and i havenow been to twenty-nine different country.Each has <br>
 given me unique learning experience.<br>

    At five. I marveled at the eiffel Tower in my city of light. When I was eight,i stood in the<br> 
    heart of the pizza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeon,then glided down venetian water way <br> 
    on sleek gondolas at thirteen, i saw the ancient, megalithic structure of of stonehenge and<br> 
    walked along the Great wall of chine, amazed that the thounsand-year old stones were still in place<br> 
  <br> 
  it was through exploring culture around the world that I first <br> 
  because interested in language.
  <br> 
  it began with french, which taught me the important of<br> 
  pronounciation. i remember once asking a store owner in paris<br> 
  where Rue des pyramides was. But when i pronounced it<br> 
  PYR-a-mides insted of par-A-mides, with more accent on<br> 
  the A, she looked at me bewildered.<br> 
  <br> 
  in the eighth grade, i become fascinatad with spanish and <br> 
  awere of it similarities with english throug cognate.<br> 
  baseball in spanish, for example,beisbal, which looks<br> 
  different but sound nearly the same.this was incredible to <br> 
  me as it made speech and comprehensiom more fluid,and even today i find that congates 
  come to the rescue when i forget the how to say something in spanish.<br> 
  <br> 
  then, in high school,i develop an enthusiasm for chinese.as i studied chinese at my
  school, i morveled how if just one sroke was missing from a character,the meaning is lost i <br> 
  love how long words were formend by combining simper character,so Huo()meaning
  fire and shan()meaning mountain can be joined to create huoshan<br>  ()which means
  volcano.i love spending hour at a time practing the character and i can feelthe beauty 
  and rhythm as i form them.
